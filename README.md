# Automated Data Acquisition and Analytics for Livestock Management using UAVs
NOTE: This is a repo containing more information of our work. Our source code and paper will be released after published.

In the context of Australia, due to its unique geographical distribution, it is difficult for farmers to closely monitor animal health and welfare. There is a need for innovative and autonomous solutions to keep up with demand in the agricultural industry. This project proposes using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as an effective solution to offer an integrated wearable sensor data acquisition and analytics platform for livestock monitoring. Using computer vision algorithms, it will deploy UAVs to fly on the farm periodically and detect livestock with collars. The UAVs then fly in close proximity to the animals and establish communication with their wearable sensors. UAVs will also pull out the raw data at high speed and transmit it to the Cloud for further analysis. Data analytics methods will run in real-time at the cloud data centre to infer valuable phenomena and alert the farmers if urgent action is necessary.
